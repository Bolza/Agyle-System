	<h3>The Philosofy behind this system</h3>	
	<p class='introduction'>
		This entire system is based on two unmovable pillars: simplicity and fun. <br>
		In game terms these two concepts are embodied in: common sense and stunts.<br><br>
		The first is a very simple concept, just follow the story, play on role and let the Storyteller decides how to read and apply the game mechanics.<br>
		The second one, the Stunt, by which this system takes its name, is a little more tricky for anyone that hasn't played the game that invented this concept: Exalted from White Wolf.

		<h4>What's a Stunt</h4>
		<p>	[TODO] Stunt Description</p>
			<h4>Stunt 1</h4><h5>Adds +2 to the dice roll</h5>
			<p></p>
			<h4>Stunt 2</h4><h5>Adds +4 to the dice roll</h5>
			<p></p>
			<h4>Stunt 3</h4><h5>Adds +6 to the dice roll</h5>
			<p></p>
		<p>
			
		</p>

		<h4>Difficulties</h4>
		<p>
			Each task, in the real life, requires some effort to be completed. The amount of effort requested, in the Stunt System, is called Difficulty and represents the target number that a PC has to score to complete the task or to pass a certain test. Each different test and situation requires to use different stats of a PC.

	<h3>Your Character</h3>
	<p class='introduction'></p>

	<h4>Gnosis</h4>
	<p>Only one value can really define the nature of a individual in this system. Gnosis is the foundamental number that evaluates the metaphisical weight of someone inside the universe. <br> 
	Every commoner have a Gnosis of 1, they aren't really important in the scheme of things, but the moment they become active, they start to think out of their homes and lives and they begin to act in the world, then they start to change it... and then their Gnosis value can increase too. <br><br>
	Certain individuals accumulate such an amount of power and knowledge that can reach a Gnosis of 5 or more. Also there are a few mortals that aren't born to be common people so they start their very life with hight gnosis values.<br><br>
	Then there are Demons, Spirits, Gods and the likes, all these creatures have their Gnosis values reflecting their power and importance, a God will always be a 15+ creature. But most of the spirits and demons have little more gnosis than a human farmer, because of their limitate power over the world. Other spirits and demons, though, can reach Gnosis levels even higher than a god. <br><br>
	
	Only two absolute rules applies to Gnosis:<br>
	Gnosis can never decrease.<br>
	And ONLY the Storyteller can say how much Gnosis a PC have, both in creation and during the story. No expenditure of XP can increase Gnosis under any circumstances.<br>
	This is because existence in itself determines your Gnosis, this is not something for a single individual, no matter how powerful, to decide or even to know.
	</p>

	<h4>Attributes</h4>
	<p>Attributes are the basic physical and mental values of your PC, these 8 statistics can go from 1 to 10 for normal peoples and can go over 10 for very special individuals. Only God-Like creatures can go over 15 in the attributes. The maximum value is 20.
	</p>

	<h5><b>(STR) STRENGHT </b></h5>
	<h5><b>(CON) CONSTITUTION </b></h5>
	<h5><b>(COO) COORDINATION </b></h5>
	<h5><b>(REF) REFLEXES </b></h5>
	<h5><b>(WIL) WILLPOWER </b></h5>
	<h5><b>(INT) INTELLIGENCE </b></h5>
	<h5><b>(CHA) CHARISMA </b></h5>
	<h5><b>(WIS) WISDOM </b></h5>
	

	<h4>Fatigues</h4><h5>FAT</h5>
	<p>In each combat turn a PC can perform actions: attack once or multiple times, defend himself, running away, making action powers, try a combat manouver... or even perform actions not related with combat. Each action takes one fatigue point to be completed.<br>
	Fatigue Points have a rating among 0, -2, -5. You can choose which FAT to use to perform a specific action, then you will act with the malus equal to the rating of the FAT.<br> 
	All fatigue points will be refilled at the beginning of your next turn.<br>
	Every charachter starts with one -0, one -2 and one -5 FAT. Anyway he can buy more using xp. 
	<br> When someone runs over of fatigues he can still perform any additional action he wants, but applying a malus of -10.</p>

	<h3>Combat System</h3>

	<p class='introduction'>
		In each combat there are some values that have to be recalculated often and other that are static: you can calculate them just once and update when you raise some statistic or equip a new item, but most of the time you won't need to make any calculation on these values. <br>


		This is a list of static stats that you have to calculate and write down on your character sheet in order to make the combat faster and smoother.<br>
		Under the complete name of the value there's the value's short name (this is how these value will be referrend in most of the manual) and the formula to calculate it. Don't worry, this system have no complicated and boring calculations, we just add some of your's PC values together. Remember we are here to play a roleplay game, not to win a math contest.
	</p>

	<p>
		<h4>Attack Pool</h4>
		<h5>[ATKPool = COO + SKILL + FOC + WEAPON_ACCURACY]</h5>
		This one is the total static attack power of your PC. 
		Skill rapresents the applicable skill for the style and equipment your PC uses in combat. Of course you will  only apply the Skill Focus if it’s applicable at master’s discretion. Weapon is specified by weapon’s precision value. 
	</p>

	<p>
		<h4>Defense Pool</h4>
		<h5>[DEFPool = REF + SKILL + FOC + WEAPON_DEFENSE]</h5>
		This one is the total static defense power of your PC. 
		Skill rapresents the applicable skill for the style and equipment your PC uses in combat. Of course you will only apply the Skill Focus if it’s applicable at master’s discretion. Weapon is specified by weapon’s defense value. 
	</p>

	<p>
		<h4>Parry Defense</h4>
		There’s no parry skill, you can apply the same skill you use to perform an attack also to parry. Anyway you can not parry ranged attacks until the use of powers that specifically allows such feats. Some weapons, when used to parry, provide a defense bonus that can be added to the total DEFPool.
	</p>

	<p>
		<h4>Shield Defense</h4>
		If you carry a shield than you can defend against any phisical attack using the shield skill. Shields have a specific defense bonus that is added to the DEFPool. Also some shield provide other bonuses. Most shields can also be used to make an attack.
	</p>

	<p>
		<h4>Dodge Defense</h4>
		You can also choose not to parry at all but try to dodge the attack. This can be done against any physical attack and even some supernatural attacks. Dodge skill value is the one you add to the DEFPool when making a defense roll, furthermore, if your defense surpasses the attack you receive, than you can make a free counterattack with a final attack equal to the difference between attack and defense.
	</p>

	<p>
		<h4>Damage Pool</h4>
		[DMGPool = [STR] + WEAPON + ATKResult]
		When Attack and Defense are calculated and subtracted then you have an Attack Result (ATKResult). At this point you add the Weapon Damage to the ATKResult and if your weapon allows it, you also add your STR value.The result of this sum is your Damage Value and is subtracted from the opponent’s HP.
	</p>

	<p>
		<h4>Critical Damage</h4>
		If the difference between Attack and Defense is higher than 10 you made a critical attack: you can ignore the armor absorbtion when calculating the damage.

<section id="idee">
	<p>Ogni feature va pensata in ambito modern|mortal|exalted</p>
	<p>Incremento di %WIN per punto ATR = 5% | SKL = 5% | WEP = 5% </p>


	<p>Vogliamo che i combattimenti mondani siano mortali e si concludano in pochi scambi, circa 5?</p>
	<p>I combattimenti exalted invece si devono poter protrarre più a lungo?</p>
	<p>Se le armature sottraggono danno: Arma piccola fa meno danno ma più critici (molti).</p>
	<p>Cerchiamo di rendere la difesa un valore fisso senza dado (stuntabile), quindi in media di 5 più alto.</p>
